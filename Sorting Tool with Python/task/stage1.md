# Stage 1:

Focus on stage 1 is processing integer inputs indefinitely.
The program should end when the user enters Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+D (Windows 11, depends on how you are running the script).

**Objectives:**

Read integers from the console until the end of the input is reached.
Compute the following information:

- The number of integers in the input (X)
- The greatest number in the input (Y)
- How many times the greatest number occurs in the input (Z)

Output it using this template:

```
Total numbers: X.
The greatest number: Y (Z time(s)).
``` 

## Example:

The greater-than symbol followed by a space `>` represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

```
> 1 -2   33 4
> 42
> 1                 1
Total numbers: 7.
The greatest number: 42 (1 time(s)).
```
